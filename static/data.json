            "0": "Also known as a mole, a melanocytic nevus is a benign (non-cancerous) growth of melanocytes. Moles can vary in color, size, and shape and are typically harmless. However, certain types of moles may have a higher risk of developing into melanoma, especially if they exhibit changes in appearance over time.",
            "1": "Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that originates in melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. It often appears as a new spot or an existing mole that changes in size, shape, or color. Melanoma has the potential to metastasize and spread to other parts of the body if not detected and treated early.",
            "2": "These are harmless skin growths like sun spots or raised bumps. Sometimes they look like cancer, so it's good to get them checked by a doctor.",
            "3": "Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer, originating in the basal cells of the skin's outermost layer. It usually appears as a small, shiny bump or a red, scaly patch on sun-exposed areas of the skin. BCC tends to grow slowly and is less likely to spread to other parts of the body compared to melanoma.",
            "4": "Actinic keratosis, also known as solar keratosis, is a precancerous growth that develops on sun-damaged skin. It appears as rough, scaly patches and has the potential to progress into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated.",
            "5": "These are issues with blood vessels in the skin, like red birthmarks or spider veins. They're usually harmless but might need treatment for looks or if they cause problems.",
            "6": "It's a harmless bump made of fibrous tissue. It can be pink or brown and might be removed if it causes trouble."
